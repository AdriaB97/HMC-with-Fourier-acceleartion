# HMC-with-Fourier-acceleartion

The program HMC_with_fourier_acc__2D_4_scalar_theory.py perfoms simulations with phi^4 scalar theory in a two-dimensional spacetime. These simulations are done using Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm with Fourier acceleration. 
The program was written in python and the only input is a json file which contains a dictionary with the values of the parameters to run the simulation. The directory of the file must be given in the command line after the name of the program. The file "conf_file.json" is an example of the type of files that the program requires as an input.
