# HMC-with-Fourier-acceleartion

The program HMC_with_fourier_acc__4_scalar_theory.py perfoms simulations with phi^4 scalar theory using Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm with Fourier acceleration. 
The program was written in python and the only input is a json file which contains a dictionary with the values of the parameters to run the simulation. The directory of the file must be given in the command line after the name of the program.
